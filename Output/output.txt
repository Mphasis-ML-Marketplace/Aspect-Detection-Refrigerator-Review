{'review': "Had buzzing noise then click as refrigerator compressor wouldn't start. Sixty bucks down the drain. Installation and demo was quick and efficient one. Purchased for reception area of dentist's office to hold bottles of water and small drinks. It looks elegant in the corner beside our coffee bar. Also from base of the refrigerator little bend I can see. The courier partner Delivery is not responding, he used to late evening that will reschedule the return request to tomorrow.",
